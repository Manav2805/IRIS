# IRIS System Monitor
IRIS is a system monitoring program that I made during summer. The main aim was to make it easier for users to check on their battery-report and other system information without the need to run complicated console commands.

## How to Run
Run the requirements.txt file to run all the modules necessary to run the program. The program can then be accessed by running main.py

## Possibile Errors
The software is indended to be run on windows operating system. Other os compatibility is not explored.

The program uses multi-threading in python which can cause unexpected errors. It should go away by rerunning the program. Feel free to inform me about the problem if it pertains.

Multi-threading may also limit the user from changing tabs in short intervals. Please wait upto two seconds.

### End Notes
Please enjoy the application and I hope that it is useful to you.

If you have any ideas for further expansions, please let me know. I would love to implement them...time permitting.
